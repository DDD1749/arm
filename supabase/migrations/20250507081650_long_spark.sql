/*
  # Fix Admin RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Simplify admin_settings policies to prevent infinite recursion
    - Update orders and order_items policies to use a more efficient admin check
    - Add proper indexes for performance

  2. Security
    - Maintain existing security model but implement it more efficiently
    - Keep admin access control while preventing recursion
    - Ensure proper row-level security is maintained
